# PSCT

This Github repository contains resources used for Genomic Analysis of Pseudomonas sp. Strain SCT, an Iodate-Reducing Bacterium Isolated from Marine Sediment. The resources include Python scripts and notebooks, and output files generated by pan-genome analysis pipelines [Roary](https://sanger-pathogens.github.io/Roary/) and [LS-BSR](https://github.com/jasonsahl/LS-BSR).

- scripts/table.csv
- scripts/rename_newick.py
- data/core_gene_alignment.phy: concatenated nucleotide sequence alignments of core genes used for phylogenetic analysis.
- data/PSCT_dup_matrix.txt: A 2x2 matrix showing how many copies of a CDS are present in each genome.
- data/PSCT_bsr_matrix.txt: The 2x2 matrix of the BSR value for each CDS in each genome queried.
